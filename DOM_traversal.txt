I said thet main advantage of document object model(DOM) is we can easily traverse our
document easily.

DOM is the document object model loaded in the browser and representing the document as
a NODE tree.In DOM where each node represent the part of the document.
(e.g an element,textString,comment).

Here, we write a basic HTML code and generate DOM using pen and paper.

<html>
    <head>
        <title>My Website</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>I am a good boy</p>
    </body>
</html>

When browser parse this html,It will create a tree structure like that

                    html
                    /   \
                   /     \
                head    body
                \           \
                title        p   
                \            \
                My Website     I am a good boy

And put this all stuff in a object,called document object and attach this on the 
window object.You can find it on console.

I attach a picture of document object(Document_object.png).

You can also see the document object.

By using

1.console.log(window.document) => It's print the html form 

2.To see the property and method of the document object,you can do

console.dir(window.document);
