I said thet main advantage of document object model(DOM) is we can easily traverse our
document easily.

DOM is the document object model loaded in the browser and representing the document as
a NODE tree.In DOM where each node represent the part of the document.
(e.g an element,textString,comment).

Here, we write a basic HTML code and generate DOM using pen and paper.
